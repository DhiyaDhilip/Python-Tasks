# Python-Tasks
Its project teaches "core programming concepts" using practical exercises. It covers "if-else statements, loops, arithmetic operations, patterns, and string handling". Tasks include calculating areas, income tax, leap years, continuous calculations, and printing patterns, helping beginners improve their  "Python logic and problem-solving skills".

##  Python Practice Tasks

### Basic Programming & Logic
1. Factorial of a given number  
2. Check if a number is prime  
3. Generate Fibonacci series  
4. Check if a string/number is a palindrome  
5. Sum of digits in a number  

### String & List Operations
6. Print alternate characters from a string  
7. Concatenate two string lists and return as a new list  
8. Access list elements using a list of indices  
9. Find largest and smallest elements in a list  
10. Sort a list in ascending and descending order using `sort()` and `sorted()`  
11. Count vowels in each word of a sentence  
12. Find second largest element and remove duplicates from a list  
13. Search for N target elements using list comprehension  
14. Sort a list without modifying the original  
15. Compute cubes of n integers using list comprehension  

### Pattern Printing
16. Print triangle pattern:  
    ```
    *
    * *
    * * *
    * * * *
    ```
17. Print increasing star pattern:  
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    ```
18. Print symmetric star pattern:  
    ```
    *
    **
    ****
    ******
    ****
    **
    *
    ```

### Tuple Operations

## Python Conditional Logic Tasks

### if–elif–else Applications
1. Geometry Formula Selector 
   - Input: S, R, T, C  
   - Output: Corresponding area formula using variables  
   - Shapes: Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle  

2. Holiday Destination Picker
   - Based on budget:  
     - > ₹50,000 → Goa  
     - > ₹30,000 → Manali  
     - > ₹10,000 → Shimla  
     - ≤ ₹10,000 → Home  

3. Income Tax Calculator 
   - Based on salary slabs (details not fully visible but likely includes conditional tax logic)
